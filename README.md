# 🕵️‍♀️ PersonaLens

**PersonaLens** is a browser extension and platform that helps developers and product teams test the accessibility of their websites using real-world personas and AI. It highlights the hidden friction real users face — whether due to disabilities, device constraints, or language barriers.

This tool was built with love during the **CustomHack Hackathon**, focused on building personalized, adaptive, and accessible software.

## 💡 What It Does

PersonaLens helps you:

- Analyze your UI and content through the lens of real user personas
- Surface accessibility issues that automated audits often miss
- Quickly test different perspectives: cognitive, visual, mobile-only, and more
- Paste your API key into the extension and start testing instantly

It's free to use, and we hope it stays that way — thanks to supporters like you.
